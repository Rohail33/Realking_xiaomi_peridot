config QCOM_PMU_LIB
	tristate "QCOM PMU Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	default n
	help
	  This enables the QCOM PMU driver which manages and maintains
	  per-CPU performance counters that are available on some
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipsets. This includes
	  preserving them across CPU idle and hotplug events.

config QCOM_DCVS_FP
	tristate "Enable QCOM DCVS Fast Path Interface"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && QCOM_RPMH
	default n
	help
	  This enables the QCOM DCVS FP (Fast Path) driver which relies on
	  certain "fast path" APIs from QCOM_RPMH to vote for various DCVS HW
	  blocks in a faster scheme than standard voting paths. This requires a
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipset that supports this feature.

config QCOM_DCVS
	tristate "QCOM DCVS Driver"
	select INTERCONNECT
	default n
	help
	  This enables the main QCOM DCVS framework which supports various
	  DCVS HW blocks and voting interfaces that are supported on some
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipsets. This includes voting
	  interfaces from both QCOM_DCVS_FP and INTERCONNECT.

config QCOM_MEMLAT
	tristate "QCOM Memlat Driver"
	depends on QCOM_DCVS && QCOM_PMU_LIB
	default n
	help
	  This enables the QCOM Memlat driver which monitors CPU performance
	  counters to identify memory latency bound workloads and vote for
	  DCVS HW (memory) frequencies through the QCOM DCVS framework. This
	  driver also configures epss memlat if enabled.

config QCOM_BWMON
	tristate "QCOM BWMON Driver"
	depends on QCOM_DCVS
	default n
	help
	  This enables the QCOM BWMON driver which monitors bandwidth counters
	  to identify memory bandwidth bound workloads and vote for DCVS HW
	  (memory) frequencies through the QCOM DCVS framework. This driver
	  handles voting for DDR and LLCC.

config QCOM_BWPROF
	tristate "QCOM BWPROF Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	default n
	help
	  This enables the QCOM BWPROF driver which monitors bandwidth counters
	  and provides them to userspace clients at modest time intervals for
	  the intention of bandwidth profiling and DDR frequency monitoring. The
	  purpose of the driver is to enable the monitoring of the bandwidth usage
	  at regular intervals, providing the userspace clients with a detailed
	  view of the current state of the system.

config QTI_PMU_SCMI_CLIENT
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver for PMU"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_PMU_PROTOCOL && QCOM_PMU_LIB
	default n
	help
	  SCMI client driver registers itself with SCMI framework for pmu
	  vendor protocol.

	  This driver delivers the pmu vendor protocol handle to interface
	  driver, and interface driver will use this handle to communicate with
	  cpucp.

config QTI_QCOM_SCMI_CLIENT
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_VENDOR_PROTOCOL
	default n
	help
	  SCMI client driver registers for Qcom vendor protocol.

	  This driver delivers the qcom vendor protocol handle to interface
	  driver, and interface driver will use this handle to communicate with
	  cpucp.

config QTI_C1DCVS_SCMI_CLIENT
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver for cpudcvs"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_C1DCVS_PROTOCOL
	default n
	help
	  SCMI client driver registers itself with SCMI framework for c1dcvs
	  vendor protocol.

	  This driver delivers the cpudcvs protocol handle to interface
	  driver, and interface driver will use this handle to communicate with
	  cpucp.

config QTI_C1DCVS_SCMI_V2
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver for C1 DCVS"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_VENDOR_PROTOCOL
	help
	  C1 DCVS driver to expose sysfs node to user space and
	  register with SCMI framework.

	  This driver is used to expose sysfs  interface to communicate
	  with cpucp for C1 DCVS based on SCMI consolidation.

config QTI_MPAM
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. MPAM Interface Driver"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_VENDOR_PROTOCOL
	default n
	help
	  Driver to expose MPAM sysfs nodes to user space.

	  This driver gathers MPAM configuration parameters from sysfs
	  userspace and relays them to CPUCP via SCMI communication.
	  It is intended to be used by clients familiar with modifying
	  the ARM MPAM configuration settings.

config QTI_CPUFREQ_STATS_SCMI_V2
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver for CPU and L3 cpu freq stats"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_VENDOR_PROTOCOL
	default n
	help
	  Driver to expose CPU freq stats debugfs nodes to user space.

	  This driver is used to expose debugfs interface to communicate
	  with cpucp for CPU freq stats based on SCMI consolidation protocol.
	  It is intended to be used by clients to get CPU and L3 residency data.

config QTI_DYNPF_SCMI
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SCMI client driver for DYNPF"
	depends on QTI_SCMI_VENDOR_PROTOCOL
	default n
	help
	  Driver to expose DYNPF configuration APIs to userspace via sysfs.

	  This driver gathers DYNPF configuration parameters from sysfs
	  userspace and relays them to CPUCP via SCMI communication.
	  It is intended to be used by clients familiar with modifying
	  the DYNPF settings.
